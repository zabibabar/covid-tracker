# covid-tracker

Covid Tracker is a personal project that I created in free time. The backend API, built with Node.js, Express, and Mongo, periodically (once a day) retrieves time series data from John Hopkins' Github Repo and saves it in Mongo. The front-end, built with React, Redux, and Material-UI use the API to create a dynamic and interactive SPA.
